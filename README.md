# JSON MCP Server

This is a JSON MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a RESTful API for querying and filtering JSON files that are stored in a local directory.

The server is built using the official Typescript SDK for Model Context Protocol servers and clients (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).

You can use this MCP server to ask questions about your JSON data, such as:

- What are the top 10 most popular products?
- What are the average prices of products in each category?
- What are the most profitable products?
